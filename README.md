[BMI as a measure is inaccurate and misleading](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/265215). [Indexâ„¢ S2 Smart Scale](https://www.garmin.com/en-NZ/p/679362) has also been reported with [limited accuracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBgNZLh5vmg), so I've built this to manually import data into Garmin Connect.
